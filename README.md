Lean API Wrapper for MediaFire in Swift

Uses session token v1, reducing complexity.  Does not provide convenience objects for api modules/actions, except for API calls that require special handling or behavior (session management and uploads for example).

See https://github.com/dhdean/mediafire/blob/master/mfcom/main.swift for a usage example.
